\title{An Integrated Multi-Criteria Decision Making Framework for Industrial Excess Heat Recovery and Utilization}

\begin{abstract}
Industrial excess heat recovery offers substantial potential for energy efficiency and a circular economy, but selecting optimal utilization strategies is a complex decision problem involving diverse, often conflicting, criteria. This paper presents a novel integrated decision-making framework to address this challenge. Our approach uniquely combines a Decision Tree for rapid feasibility screening with a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) model leveraging AHP for weighting stakeholder priorities and TOPSIS for ranking potential solutions. Applied to six diverse case studies from a real-world project database, our framework demonstrates its efficacy in identifying promising heat recovery pathways while highlighting the critical influence of criteria weighting on final recommendations. A sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of our approach. This integrated framework contributes a practical and robust tool for sustainable excess heat management, informing more informed decision-making and offering a pathway for improved industrial energy efficiency. Further research can explore incorporating dynamic parameters and enhancing framework accessibility through software development.

\section{Case Studies and Experimental Results}
This section presents six diverse case studies selected from the EMB3Rs project database to demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed integrated decision-making framework for industrial excess heat recovery and utilization. The cases were chosen based on four key criteria: diversity of industrial sectors, representation of different geographical locations, varying excess heat characteristics, and inclusion of real-world complexities. They span industries including cement production, metal casting, chemicals, textiles, waste incineration, and food processing across Portugal, the UK, Greece, Sweden, and Denmark.

\subsection{Overview of Case Studies}
This section provides an overview of the six diverse case studies analyzed in this research, each selected to represent a unique industrial context for excess heat recovery. Table \ref{tab:merged_case_overview} summarizes the key characteristics of these cases, including the industry sector, geographical location, the number of alternatives and criteria considered in the decision-making process, key features of each case, and the specific characteristics of the available excess heat. These cases were carefully chosen to represent a variety of industrial contexts and decision-making scenarios. The selection criteria focused on the diversity of industrial sectors, spanning cement production, metal casting, multi-sectoral industrial parks, and district heating applications. The geographical distribution across Portugal, the UK, Greece, Sweden, and Denmark reflects a range of European energy systems and priorities. The cases also present a spectrum of excess heat characteristics, from high-temperature sources in cement production to low-temperature waste heat in residential district heating. Furthermore, the varying number of alternatives and criteria considered highlights the inherent real-world complexities of each case.

\end{table}

The following points briefly outline the key features and decision contexts of each case, further elaborating on the information presented in Table \ref{tab:merged_case_overview}:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Case 1: Cement Production (Portugal)}: This case, with its focus on the cement sector, considers three alternative heat utilization pathways evaluated against four criteria. The primary challenge involves managing high-temperature excess heat and navigating seasonal variations in heat availability.
    \item \textbf{Case 2: Metal Casting (UK)}: This metal casting case study, involving three alternatives and four criteria, centers on process integration and grapples with constraints related to grid capacity for electricity export. The excess heat is characterized by medium temperatures.
    \item \textbf{Case 3: Industrial Park (Greece)}: Examining a multi-stakeholder context within an industrial park, this case explores three alternatives, assessed using four criteria, for integrating diverse, varying-temperature excess heat streams from chemical and textile manufacturers.
    \item \textbf{Case 4: District Heating (Portugal)}: This case, focusing on public infrastructure for district heating, evaluates two alternatives against five criteria. A key feature is the consideration of community acceptance for integrating low- to medium-temperature heat from waste incineration and industrial sources.
    \item \textbf{Case 5: Multi-Sectoral District Heating (Sweden)}: This case study explores cross-sector integration within a district heating network, considering two alternatives and four criteria.

    \item \textbf{Case 6: Residential District Heating (Denmark)}: This case investigates a residential district heating system, analyzing two alternatives using four criteria, and focusing on the implementation of P2P energy trading and the integration of excess heat from a CHP plant.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
To evaluate the effectiveness and reliability of different MCDM methods for industrial excess heat utilization decisions, we conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis across five widely-used methods: TOPSIS, WSM (Weighted Sum Model), WPM (Weighted Product Model), VIKOR, and PROMETHEE. These methods were selected based on their prevalence in energy systems decision-making literature and their diverse mathematical approaches to ranking alternatives.

\subsubsection{Case Study Dataset}
The evaluation leveraged a comprehensive dataset gathered from six distinct industrial case studies, details of which are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:merged_case_overview}. To populate the performance data for each potential heat utilization alternative within these cases, a multi-faceted approach to data collection was employed. This included conducting process simulations using industry-standard software such as EnergyPRO and Aspen HYSYS to model the technical performance of different heat recovery options. Financial viability was assessed through detailed evaluations incorporating vendor quotes for equipment and engineering estimates for installation and operational costs. For criteria that are inherently qualitative in nature, insights were gathered through stakeholder surveys, ensuring that the perspectives and priorities of relevant actors were incorporated into the decision-making process. Finally, publicly available energy databases were consulted to obtain relevant market-related parameters necessary for a comprehensive assessment of each alternative's feasibility and impact.

\subsubsection{Evaluation Framework}
To rigorously assess the performance of each MCDM method, a comprehensive evaluation framework was established, incorporating several key metrics. \textbf{Ranking Consistency} was quantified by calculating Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between the rankings produced by different methods, providing insights into the degree of agreement between their recommendations. \textbf{Stability (also called weight sensitivity)} of the methods was assessed by conducting a sensitivity analysis, systematically varying the criteria weights by ±10\% and ±20\% from their baseline values. This allowed us to observe how robust the rankings were against plausible changes in stakeholder priorities or uncertainties in weight estimations. We also tracked \textbf{Rank Reversals}, specifically monitoring instances where the preferred order of alternatives changed due to the aforementioned weight variations, as a means to identify criteria that had a strong influence on the ranking. Finally, \textbf{Statistical Significance} of any ranking differences between the methods was evaluated by applying Friedman's test, a non-parametric statistical test used to identify statistically significant differences suitable for comparing multiple related samples.

\subsubsection{Implementation Details}
To ensure a fair and consistent comparison across all MCDM methods, the criteria weights obtained through the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), as detailed in Table \ref{table:AHP_weights}, were consistently applied. The decision matrices were normalized using the min-max scaling approach, as described by the following equation:
\begin{equation}
x_{normalized} = \frac{x - x_{min}}{x_{max} - x_{min}}    
\end{equation}

This approach ensures that all criteria are on a comparable scale, regardless of their original units. For the VIKOR and PROMETHEE methods, specific parameters were set to align with standard practices. The VIKOR method's consensus parameter, denoted as \textit{v}, was set to 0.5. For the PROMETHEE method, a Type V preference function was employed, with preference thresholds dynamically derived from the data ranges in each case study. All methods were implemented in Python 3.8, utilizing the NumPy library for matrix operations and SciPy for statistical analyses. The complete source code and the associated data are available in a public repository at \href{https://github.com/xiufengliu/mcdm}{https://github.com/xiufengliu/mcdm}.

\subsection{Framework Application and Results}

This section details the systematic application of the proposed integrated decision-making framework to the six diverse case studies. The framework, consisting of a Decision Tree (DT) for feasibility screening, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for determining criteria weights, and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for final option ranking, was rigorously tailored to the unique context of each case.

\subsubsection{Decision Tree Screening}
The Decision Tree (DT) model served as an efficient initial screening tool, quickly filtering out technically or logistically infeasible options based on key parameters and expert-defined thresholds. These thresholds, which varied across the different case studies, were established using a combination of literature review, industry expert consultations, and best practice guidelines. The detailed criteria and thresholds for each case are presented in the Appendix in Table \ref{table:DT_criteria}. The decision tree analysis focused on critical decision points specific to each case study. 

To illustrate the decision tree process, Figure \ref{fig:decision_tree_case1} depicts the DT model applied to Case 1 (Cement Production). As shown in the figure, the decision-making process starts by evaluating the excess heat temperature. If the temperature exceeds 150°C, the analysis then checks the annual operating hours of the excess heat source. For Case 1, a minimum of 6,000 operating hours was set, which is reflective of the continuous operation of cement kilns, ensuring sufficient heat availability for viable utilization. If both of these criteria are satisfied, the feasibility of options for district heating is determined by the distance to potential users, which was set to less than 3 kilometers to avoid significant heat losses over longer distances. This structured approach effectively narrowed down the initial set of potential excess heat utilization options to a smaller, more manageable set of feasible alternatives. These feasible alternatives then proceeded to the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) stage for a comprehensive evaluation and ranking.

\begin{figure}[htp]

    \includegraphics[width=0.75\columnwidth]{images/decision_tree_case1.pdf}
    \caption{Decision Tree for Case 1: Cement Production.}
    \label{fig:decision_tree_case1}
\end{figure}

In summary, the Decision Tree screening identified the following feasible options for each case study:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Case 1 (Cement Production):} Internal Process Heat Recovery, Alternative Fuel Drying, and District Heating.
    \item \textbf{Case 2 (Metal Casting):} Electricity Generation, Heat-to-Fuel Conversion, and Process Integration.
    \item \textbf{Case 3 (Industrial Park):} Inter-industry Heat Exchange, Integration with District Heating Network, and Individual Solutions.
    \item \textbf{Case 4 (District Heating):} District Heating Network Integration and Process Steam Supply.
    \item \textbf{Case 5 (Multi-Sectoral District Heating):} District Heating Expansion with Industrial Heat and Individual Industry Solutions.
    \item \textbf{Case 6 (Residential District Heating with P2P):} P2P with CHP Integration and District Heating without CHP.
\end{itemize}
The subsequent sections will detail the application of the MCDM methods to rank these feasible options.

\subsubsection{Multi-Criteria Analysis}
The multi-criteria analysis involved two key components: determining the criteria weights using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and then comparatively evaluating the feasible options using five different Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods. The AHP process, which was conducted for each case study, consistently yielded weights with a Consistency Ratio (CR) below 0.1, indicating reliable pairwise comparisons. Detailed AHP matrices for each case are provided in the Appendix.

\paragraph{Ranking Performance}
Table~\ref{tab:method_comparison} presents a summary of the ranking results across all five MCDM methods for each case study. Several notable observations can be made from these results. Firstly, there is generally high concordance between the rankings generated by TOPSIS and WSM methods. Secondly, VIKOR tends to show more distinctive ranking patterns compared to the other methods, particularly in Cases 2 and 5. Lastly, the PROMETHEE method demonstrated a sensitivity to the choice of preference functions, especially when evaluating qualitative criteria.

Case 6 & 1-2 & 1-2 & 1-2 & 1-2 & 1-2 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Statistical Validation}
To assess the statistical significance of any differences in the rankings produced by the different MCDM methods, Friedman's test was conducted. The results of the test indicated no statistically significant differences between the methods at a significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$. However, a post-hoc analysis revealed a stronger level of agreement between the TOPSIS and WSM pairs compared to other pairs.

\paragraph{Stability Analysis}
A sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the robustness of the rankings to variations in the criteria weights. Specifically, weights were varied by ±10\% and ±20\% from their baseline AHP values. The results of this analysis, summarized in Table \ref{table:sensitivity_summary}, revealed varying degrees of stability across the different MCDM methods. TOPSIS demonstrated the highest overall stability, while VIKOR exhibited increased sensitivity to weight variations, particularly in Cases 2 and 5. In general, WSM and WPM methods maintained consistent rankings under moderate weight variations (±10\%).

\paragraph{Method Correlation}
Figure~\ref{fig:method_correlation} visually represents the correlation between the different MCDM methods' rankings, using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. The visualization shows a strong positive correlation between the rankings produced by TOPSIS and WSM ($\rho = 0.92$), indicating a high level of agreement between these two methods. VIKOR demonstrates a moderate level of correlation with other methods, ranging from 0.76 to 0.84. The PROMETHEE method consistently exhibits distinct patterns when compared to other methods, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.85 to 0.89.

\end{figure}

The overall comparative analysis highlights that while the different MCDM methods tend to generate similar rankings, they exhibit notable variations in their stability and sensitivity to changes in the criteria weights. The TOPSIS and WSM methods displayed the most robust performance across all six cases, and VIKOR provided interesting complementary insights due to its slightly distinctive ranking patterns.

\end{itemize}

The comprehensive analysis, combining both visual and numerical results, demonstrates that while different MCDM methods generally lead to similar rankings, TOPSIS and WSM show the most robust performance across all cases. The visual representations particularly highlight the patterns of agreement between methods and help identify cases where methods produce distinctive rankings.

\subsection{Case-Specific Findings}
The analysis of method performance across different case types reveals distinct patterns and insights specific to each industrial context.

\subsubsection{Industrial Process Cases (1-3)}
\paragraph{Case 1: Cement Production}
The comparison of methods for the cement production case showed consistent rankings across all methods:
\begin{itemize}
    \item All methods ranked Internal Process Heat Recovery as the preferred option
    \item Alternative Fuel Drying consistently ranked second
    \item District Heating ranked third, though its closeness scores were sensitive to CO2 reduction weights
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Case 2: Metal Casting}
This case demonstrated the highest variability in method performance:
\begin{itemize}
    \item TOPSIS and WSM favored Electricity Generation
    \item VIKOR showed rank reversal between Electricity Generation and Process Integration when NPV weights were varied
    \item All methods consistently ranked Heat-to-Fuel Conversion as the intermediate option
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Case 3: Industrial Park}
The industrial park case showed strong agreement across methods:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Inter-industry Heat Exchange consistently ranked first
    \item Integration with DH Network ranked second
    \item Individual Solutions ranked third with stable scores
    \item Closeness scores remained relatively stable across all weight variations
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{District Heating Cases (4-5)}
\paragraph{Case 4: District Heating Network}
The analysis of the district heating network case revealed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Unanimous preference for DH Network Integration across all methods
    \item Process Steam Supply consistently ranked second
    \item Small variations in closeness scores when Public Acceptance weights were adjusted
    \item High stability scores across all methods (>0.95)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Case 5: Multi-Sectoral District Heating}
This case showed some method-specific variations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item TOPSIS and WSM favored DH with Industrial Heat
    \item VIKOR and WPM showed sensitivity to Cost-Effectiveness criteria
    \item Individual Industry Solutions maintained consistent second rank
    \item Stability analysis revealed moderate sensitivity to weight variations
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Food Processing Case (6)}
The food processing case demonstrated unique characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item P2P with CHP Integration consistently ranked first across all methods
    \item DH without CHP maintained stable second position
    \item Consumer Benefits criterion showed significant influence on closeness scores
    \item High method agreement (Kendall's W = 1.000)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Cross-Case Analysis}
Several patterns emerged across the different case types:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Industrial Process Cases:} Showed highest variability in method performance, particularly in cases with complex technical trade-offs (Case 2)
    \item \textbf{District Heating Cases:} Demonstrated strong method agreement, especially for clear technical advantages (Case 4)
    \item \textbf{Food Processing Case:} Exhibited highest stability across all methods, likely due to well-defined criteria and clear performance differences
\end{itemize}

Table~\ref{tab:case_summary} summarizes the key findings across all cases:

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Summary of Case-Specific Method Performance}
\label{tab:case_summary}
\begin{tabular}{p{2cm}|p{2.5cm}|p{2.5cm}|p{2.5cm}|p{2.5cm}}
\hline
\textbf{Case Type} & \textbf{Method Agreement} & \textbf{Stability} & \textbf{Sensitive Criteria} & \textbf{Key Insights} \\
\hline
Industrial Process & Moderate to High & Variable & NPV, CO2 Reduction & Technical trade-offs critical \\
District Heating & High & High & Cost-Effectiveness & Clear technical preferences \\
Food Processing & Very High & Very High & Consumer Benefits & Well-defined criteria advantage \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

These findings suggest that method selection becomes more critical in cases with complex technical trade-offs and multiple competing objectives, particularly in industrial process applications. Conversely, cases with clear technical advantages or well-defined criteria show high consistency across different MCDM methods.

\subsection{Discussion and Practical Implications}

\subsubsection{Method Selection Guidelines}
Our comprehensive analysis reveals distinct patterns in method performance across different industrial contexts. For complex industrial processes, TOPSIS emerges as the primary recommended method, demonstrating superior stability (0.991) and consistent performance across all cases. WSM serves effectively as a verification method, given its strong correlation with TOPSIS ($ρ = 0.92$). In cases requiring deeper insight into criteria trade-offs, particularly in multi-stakeholder scenarios, VIKOR provides valuable complementary perspectives despite its higher sensitivity to weight variations.

District heating projects demonstrate remarkable consistency across all tested methods, as evidenced by perfect Kendall's W scores. This suggests that for such applications, method selection may be guided primarily by computational simplicity and ease of stakeholder communication. The sensitivity analysis reveals particular robustness in district heating cases, with only minor variations in rankings when adjusting weights for public acceptance and cost-effectiveness criteria.

\subsubsection{Implementation Considerations}
The practical implementation of MCDM methods in industrial excess heat utilization requires careful attention to three key aspects: data quality, stakeholder engagement, and technical integration. Data quality considerations stem from our experience across the six case studies, where performance data was gathered through multiple channels including process simulations, financial assessments, and stakeholder surveys, as detailed in Section 4.1 (reference to lines 66-72). The normalization approach using min-max scaling, while effective, requires careful validation of input data to prevent distortion of results.

Stakeholder engagement emerged as a critical success factor, particularly in cases involving multiple industrial partners or community stakeholders. The case studies demonstrate that transparent documentation of the decision-making process, including clear articulation of criteria weights and sensitivity analyses, significantly enhances stakeholder buy-in. This is particularly evident in Case 3 (Industrial Park), where complex inter-stakeholder relationships necessitated careful balance of competing priorities.

Technical integration considerations focus on the practical aspects of implementing the selected solutions. The decision tree approach, as illustrated in Case 1 (reference to lines 24-31), provides a structured framework for initial feasibility screening. This systematic approach should be integrated with existing technical assessment tools while maintaining flexibility for case-specific adaptations.

\subsubsection{Limitations and Future Work}
The current study's limitations span methodological, data, and validation aspects. From a methodological perspective, while our analysis covers five prominent MCDM methods, the field offers additional approaches that merit investigation. The current framework's treatment of uncertainty is primarily through sensitivity analysis, suggesting potential benefits from incorporating fuzzy set theory or probabilistic approaches in future work.

Data limitations primarily stem from the geographical and sectoral scope of our case studies. While the selected cases represent diverse industrial contexts, broader validation across different regions and industrial sectors would strengthen the framework's generalizability. The treatment of technological evolution and long-term performance metrics remains an area for future development.

Future research directions should address these limitations through three primary avenues. First, methodological extensions should explore dynamic weight adjustment mechanisms and hybrid approaches combining multiple MCDM methods. Second, application extensions should focus on integrating the framework with energy system modeling tools and developing real-time decision support capabilities. Finally, validation extensions should establish protocols for long-term performance monitoring of implemented solutions, enabling comparison between predicted and actual outcomes.

The framework's current success in handling diverse industrial cases, while maintaining methodological rigor, suggests its potential as a foundation for standardized decision support in industrial excess heat utilization. However, realizing this potential requires continued refinement through practical application and systematic validation across broader industrial contexts.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion} 
This research addressed the challenge of prioritizing industrial excess heat recovery and utilization strategies through the development and application of an integrated decision-making framework.  The comprehensive evaluation of the framework, incorporating diverse industrial case studies with varying complexities, consistently demonstrated its effectiveness in identifying and ranking promising utilization options, incorporating technical, economic, environmental, and social factors aligned with context-specific stakeholder priorities. Sensitivity analysis further confirmed the robustness of the decision recommendations generated by the framework, reinforcing its capacity to navigate uncertainties inherent in this decision-making domain. The inclusion of a Decision Tree for preliminary screening sets this framework apart, enhancing efficiency and focusing the analysis on genuinely viable alternatives, a feature often lacking in current decision support tools for excess heat recovery. By incorporating this initial feasibility screening stage, this framework becomes a valuable tool for industrial practitioners and policymakers seeking to navigate the complexities of excess heat recovery planning and implementation, ultimately driving progress towards greater industrial sustainability and a lower-carbon future.

\subsection{Illustrative TOPSIS Calculation Example (Case 3: Industrial Park)}
\label{appendix:cal_example}
This appendix provides a concise overview of the TOPSIS calculation process applied to Case 3 (Industrial Park) to rank excess heat utilization options.

\paragraph{Step 1: Normalized Performance Matrix}
The performance matrix is normalized by dividing each criterion value by the square root of the sum of the squares of the corresponding criterion values across all alternatives. The normalized performance matrix is presented in Table~\ref{table:TOPSIS_case3}.

\paragraph{Step 2: Weighted Normalized Matrix}
Each normalized performance value is then multiplied by its corresponding weight derived from the AHP process. The weights for Case 3 are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Economic Synergy Potential: 0.35
    \item Energy Efficiency Improvement: 0.25
    \item Reduction in External Energy Dependence: 0.20
    \item Ease of Implementation: 0.20
\end{itemize}

\noindent The resulting weighted normalized matrix is:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Weighted Normalized Matrix - Case 3 (Industrial Park)}
\label{table:weighted_normalized_matrix}
\begin{tabular}{|l|cccc|}
\hline
\textbf{Utilization Option} & \textbf{Economic} & \textbf{Energy} & \textbf{External} & \textbf{Ease of} \\
 & \textbf{Synergy} & \textbf{Efficiency} & \textbf{Energy} & \textbf{Implementation} \\
 & & \textbf{Improvement} & \textbf{Dependence} & \\ \hline
Inter-industry Heat Exchange & 0.315 & 0.1875 & 0.16 & 0.14 \\ \hline
Integration with DH Network & 0.21 & 0.2125 & 0.18 & 0.12 \\ \hline
Individual Solutions & 0.14 & 0.125 & 0.12 & 0.16 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Step 3: Ideal and Negative-Ideal Solutions}
The ideal solution represents the best values across all criteria, while the negative-ideal solution represents the worst values:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ideal Solution (A\textsuperscript{*}): [0.315, 0.2125, 0.18, 0.16]
    \item Negative-Ideal Solution (A\textsuperscript{-}): [0.14, 0.125, 0.12, 0.12]
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Step 4: Distance Calculations}
The Euclidean distance of each alternative from the ideal and negative-ideal solutions is calculated.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Distances from Ideal and Negative-Ideal Solutions - Case 3}
\label{table:distances_case3}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Utilization Option} & \textbf{S\textsuperscript{*}} (Distance to Ideal) & \textbf{S\textsuperscript{-}} (Distance to Negative-Ideal) \\ \hline
Inter-industry Heat Exchange & 0.084 & 0.192 \\ \hline
Integration with DH Network & 0.118 & 0.141 \\ \hline
Individual Solutions & 0.202 & 0.045 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Step 5: Relative Closeness Calculation}
The relative closeness $C_i$ of each option to the ideal solution is calculated as follows:
\[
C_i = \frac{S^-}{S^* + S^-}
\]

\begin{table}[H]

\caption{Relative Closeness Scores and Ranking - Case 3}
\label{table:closeness_case3}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Utilization Option} & \textbf{C\textsubscript{i}} (Relative Closeness) & \textbf{Ranking} \\ \hline
Inter-industry Heat Exchange & 0.694 & 1 \\ \hline
Integration with DH Network & 0.544 & 2 \\ \hline
Individual Solutions & 0.182 & 3 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Step 6: Ranking}
Based on the relative closeness scores, Inter-industry Heat Exchange is ranked as the most favorable option for Case 3.
