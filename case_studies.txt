\subsection{Case Study Descriptions}
\label{sec:detailed_cases}

\textbf{Case 1: Cement Production:} This case focuses on the CIMPOR cement plant in Souselas, Portugal. The plant's dry-process kiln generates exhaust gases reaching temperatures up to 500°C, representing an estimated annual excess heat potential of 50 MWth (based on process data). The primary challenge is managing the fluctuating excess heat availability due to seasonal cement demand variations, which can reach up to 20\%. The case explores the feasibility of: 1) Internal Process Heat Recovery, 2) Alternative Fuel Drying, and 3) supplying heat to a nearby industrial park or residential area through a District Heating network, while contending with potential permitting constraints. The central decision involves choosing the optimal utilization pathway — whether to prioritize internal heat recovery, invest in a district heating network, or pursue a combination of both.

\textbf{Case 2: Metal Casting:} This case study centers on an aluminum casting facility in the UK facing the challenge of limited grid capacity for exporting electricity generated from recovered heat. The melting furnaces and heat treatment processes generate excess heat reaching 400°C with a potential of roughly 10 MWth per year (estimated from energy audits). The case explores the feasibility of:  1) Electricity Generation, 2) converting excess heat into synthetic fuels (Heat-to-Fuel Conversion), and 3) Process Integration. The facility also faces land use constraints, limiting opportunities for expansive infrastructure for heat recovery and utilization. The key decision involves selecting the most advantageous utilization route within these constraints.

\textbf{Case 3: Industrial Park:} This case examines an industrial park in Greece housing chemical and textile manufacturers with diverse heat demands. The diverse industrial processes result in varying excess heat streams, ranging from 80°C to 285°C, totaling approximately 30 MWth (based on data provided by the participating companies).  The primary challenge lies in determining the optimal approach to managing these diverse heat streams: 1) promoting Inter-industry Heat Exchange, where excess heat from one company is used by another within the park; 2) integrating the park's excess heat with a nearby District Heating Network; or 3) allowing individual facilities to pursue their own Individual Heat Recovery solutions. Complicating the decision are uncertainties regarding the future expansion plans of the park, which could significantly impact the long-term viability and effectiveness of the chosen strategy. 

\textbf{Case 4: District Heating:} This case analyzes the integration of excess heat from a Lisbon waste incinerator and nearby industrial facilities into the Parque das Nações district heating network. This scenario presents a substantial opportunity with an estimated 80 MWth of excess heat potentially available. Key challenges involve adapting the existing district heating infrastructure to accommodate diverse heat sources, managing public perception related to using heat derived from waste incineration, and ensuring regulatory compliance for connecting various heat sources. This case focuses on evaluating the feasibility and benefits of integrating these new heat sources into the existing District Heating Network compared to the current configuration. 

\textbf{Case 5: Multi-Sectoral District Heating:} This case study explores the expansion of the Landskrona (Sweden) district heating network to incorporate excess heat from the "Krona" industrial park, which boasts a potential exceeding 100 MWth. The central decision in this case revolves around expanding the existing DH network to accommodate the new industrial heat sources (District Heating Expansion with Industrial Heat) versus relying on individual heat management strategies within the industrial park (Individual Industry Solutions). The main complexities involve optimizing the expanded system to balance the diverse heat demands of residential, commercial, and industrial users while ensuring the long-term economic and technical feasibility of the project.  

\textbf{Case 6: Residential District Heating with P2P:} This case examines the EnergyLab Nordhavn district in Copenhagen, Denmark, exploring the potential for incorporating industrial excess heat into a residential district heating network operating under a peer-to-peer (P2P) market structure. The primary focus is evaluating the effectiveness of a P2P market-based approach for optimizing excess heat utilization within a residential district heating network (P2P with CHP Integration) compared to the traditional centralized management approach (District Heating without CHP). Key complexities involve designing dynamic pricing mechanisms, promoting consumer engagement and participation in the P2P market, and integrating with local renewable energy sources.

These case studies, with their diverse characteristics and inherent complexities, provide a comprehensive basis for evaluating the proposed decision-making framework across various industrial scenarios and heat recovery challenges.

\subsection{Application of the Decision-Making Framework}
This section details the systematic application of the proposed integrated decision-making framework to the six diverse case studies outlined in Section~\ref{sec:detailed_cases}. The framework, consisting of a Decision Tree (DT) for feasibility screening, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for determining criteria weights, and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for final option ranking, was rigorously tailored to the unique context of each case. This comprehensive approach underscores the framework's adaptability and practical relevance in navigating real-world complexities associated with industrial excess heat recovery and utilization.

\subsubsection{Decision Tree Application}
The Decision Tree model provided an efficient method for initial screening, eliminating technically and logistically infeasible options based on key parameters and expert-defined thresholds. These thresholds were established through a combination of literature review, consultation with industry experts, and analysis of best practice guidelines within each industrial sector. Table \ref{table:DT_criteria} summarizes the criteria and thresholds employed for each case study, reflecting the unique challenges and opportunities associated with different industrial contexts. 

Figure \ref{fig:decision_tree_case1} visually depicts the Decision Tree model applied to Case 1 (Cement Production). As illustrated in the diagram, the decision-making process begins by evaluating the excess heat temperature. If the temperature exceeds 150°C, the analysis proceeds to consider the annual operating hours of the excess heat source. For Case 1, the requirement for a minimum of 6,000 operating hours reflects the continuous operation of cement kilns, ensuring sufficient heat availability for viable utilization. If both these criteria are satisfied, the feasibility of each potential utilization option hinges on the distance to potential district heating users. Given the potential for significant heat losses over long distances and the need to minimize transport costs, a proximity of less than 3 kilometers is deemed essential for economic viability in the context of district heating.  

\begin{figure}[htp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\columnwidth]{images/decision_tree_case1.pdf}
    \caption{Decision Tree for Case 1: Cement Production.}
    \label{fig:decision_tree_case1}
\end{figure}

Through this structured assessment, the Decision Tree effectively narrows down the potential utilization options for Case 1 to \textbf{Internal Process Heat Recovery}, \textbf{Alternative Fuel Drying}, and \textbf{District Heating}. These feasible alternatives then undergo a comprehensive multi-criteria evaluation using AHP and TOPSIS, which will be detailed in the following subsections.
\subsubsection{AHP Application}
The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was employed to determine the relative weights of the multiple criteria influencing excess heat utilization decisions in each case study. Stakeholders, including engineers, managers, and representatives from local communities and authorities, actively engaged in structured workshops to systematically compare pairs of criteria and express their preferences using Saaty's 1-9 scale.  For example, if stakeholders considered `CO2 Emission Reduction' to be moderately more important than `Investment Cost', a judgment score of 3 would be assigned, where 1 represents `Equal Importance' and 9 represents `Extreme Importance'.  These pairwise comparisons were organized into matrices, from which criteria weights are derived.

To ensure the consistency of the judgments provided by stakeholders, a consistency ratio (CR) is calculated for each pairwise comparison matrix. A CR below 0.1 is generally considered acceptable, indicating that the judgments are sufficiently consistent to produce reliable weights \citep{saaty2002decision}. A higher CR suggests potential inconsistencies that may require further review and discussion with the stakeholders to achieve a more reliable set of weights. To illustrate the AHP process, let's examine Case 1 (Cement Production), where stakeholders prioritized four key criteria: Investment Cost, Operational Cost, CO2 Emission Reduction, and Social Acceptance. Table~\ref{table:AHP_excerpt} presents an excerpt from the pairwise comparison matrix for this case.
\begin{table}[h!]
\caption{Pairwise Comparison Matrix - Case 1 (Cement Production)\label{table:AHP_excerpt}}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Criterion} & \textbf{Investment Cost} & \textbf{Operational Cost} & \textbf{CO2 Reduction} & \textbf{Social Acceptance} \\ \hline
\textbf{Investment Cost} & 1 & 2  & 1/7 & 3 \\ \hline
\textbf{Operational Cost} & 1/2  & 1 & 1/9 & 2 \\ \hline
\textbf{CO2 Reduction} & 7 & 9 & 1 & 5 \\ \hline
\textbf{Social Acceptance} & 1/3  & 1/2  & 1/5 & 1 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\vspace{10pt}
\textbf{Priority Vector:} [0.161, 0.099, 0.664, 0.077];
\textbf{CR:} 0.097;
\textbf{CI:} 0.087;  
$\mathbf{\lambda_{max}}$\textbf{:} 4.262
\end{table}
In this example, stakeholders judged CO2 Emission Reduction as extremely more important than Investment Cost (score of 7), very strongly more important than Operational Cost (score of 9), and strongly more important than Social Acceptance (score of 5). As the matrix is reciprocal, if Criterion A is judged $n$ times more important than Criterion B, then Criterion B is automatically considered $1/n$ times as important as Criterion A.

From this matrix excerpt, the calculated weights for each criterion are: Investment Cost (\textbf{0.161}), Operational Cost (\textbf{0.099}), CO2 Reduction (\textbf{0.664}), and Social Acceptance (\textbf{0.077}). These weights highlight the strong emphasis placed on environmental concerns, particularly CO2 Reduction, by the stakeholders involved in Case 1. For this excerpt, the consistency ratio (CR) is 0.097, below the 0.1 threshold, signifying acceptable consistency in the judgments and indicating the derived weights are reliable.

The AHP process was systematically repeated for all six case studies, incorporating input from relevant stakeholders and considering criteria tailored to each specific context (summarized in Table \ref{table:AHP_criteria}).  Table \ref{table:AHP_weights} presents the final weights obtained for each criterion across all case studies, highlighting the varying priorities across different industrial contexts. For instance, in Case 1 and Case 4, which both involve the potential for significant CO2 emissions, CO2 reduction received the highest weighting. However, in Case 2 and Case 5, economic considerations were paramount.

The complete pairwise comparison matrices, with the calculated weights and consistency ratios, are presented in Appendix A for complete transparency. These weights serve as crucial inputs for the subsequent TOPSIS analysis, guiding the process of evaluating and ranking excess heat utilization options while ensuring the recommendations reflect the priorities of stakeholders involved in each distinct case study.

\subsubsection{MCDM Method Application (TOPSIS)}
The feasible excess heat utilization options for each case study, as identified through the Decision Tree analysis, were then evaluated using TOPSIS.  The criteria considered in TOPSIS are the same as those used in the AHP (see Table~\ref{table:AHP_criteria}), ensuring that the final ranking reflects the context-specific priorities determined through stakeholder input. 

Performance data for the feasible options, identified by the Decision Tree, were compiled for each criterion across all cases. These data were drawn from reliable sources to reflect realistic assessments, including:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=-3pt, topsep=0pt, partopsep=0pt]
\item \textbf{Process simulations:} Tools such as EnergyPRO and Aspen HYSYS were utilized to simulate the chosen utilization options, enabling the estimation of key performance parameters, including energy efficiency and CO2 emissions reductions.
\item \textbf{Financial data:} Investment and operational cost estimations were derived from various sources, including equipment vendor quotes, detailed engineering cost estimates based on comparable projects, and publicly available financial reports from similar industrial facilities.
\item \textbf{Public databases:} The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) and Eurostat provided data for energy pricing forecasts, supporting the assessment of long-term economic viability.
\item \textbf{Stakeholder surveys and interviews:} Qualitative assessments of social acceptance and community impacts were based on data gathered through structured interviews and questionnaires, with responses quantified using Likert scales (1-5).
\end{itemize}
To ensure direct comparability across diverse units, min-max scaling normalized the gathered performance data:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:minmax}
x_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{x - x_{\text{min}}}{x_{\text{max}} - x_{\text{min}}}
\end{equation}
where $x$ is the original value, $x_{\text{min}}$ is the minimum, and $x_{\text{max}}$ is the maximum value across all considered options for a particular criterion.
To demonstrate the TOPSIS implementation, consider Case 3 (Industrial Park). The feasible options for this case were determined to be: 1) Inter-industry heat exchange, 2) Integration with the existing district heating network, and 3) Implementing individual heat recovery solutions for each facility.  Table~\ref{table:TOPSIS_excerpt} presents an excerpt from the normalized performance matrix for Case 3, illustrating how these options performed across key criteria. 
\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{Excerpt from Normalized Performance Matrix - Case 3 (Industrial Park)}
\label{table:TOPSIS_excerpt}
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{2cm}p{2.5cm}p{2.5cm}p{2.5cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Utilization Option} & \textbf{Economic} & \textbf{Energy} & \textbf{External} & \textbf{Ease of}  \\ 
 & \textbf{Synergy} & \textbf{Efficiency} & \textbf{Energy} & \textbf{Implementation}  \\ 
 & & \textbf{Improvement} & \textbf{Dependence} &  \\ \hline
\textbf{Inter-industry Heat Exchange} & 0.90 & 0.75 & 0.80 & 0.70 \\
\textbf{Integration with DH Network} & 0.60 & 0.85 & 0.90 & 0.60 \\ 
\textbf{Individual Solutions} & 0.40 & 0.50 & 0.60 & 0.80 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The performance values in Table~\ref{table:TOPSIS_excerpt} were derived from various data sources, including process simulations using EnergyPRO to estimate energy efficiency improvements and expert evaluations based on technical feasibility studies for ease of implementation scores. For instance, Inter-industry heat exchange scores highly on Economic Synergy (0.90), reflecting the potential for strong economic benefits through collaboration between companies within the park. However, it scores lower on Ease of Implementation (0.70), acknowledging the coordination and infrastructure challenges involved in such a project.

To ensure comparability across the varying units and scales of these criteria, the data were normalized using min-max scaling (see Eq.~\ref{eq:minmax}). The complete normalized performance matrices and complete ranking results for all six case studies are available in \ref{appendix:TOPSIS}.
TOPSIS then utilizes these normalized values to determine the Euclidean distances between each alternative and both an ideal solution (representing the best possible performance across all criteria) and a negative-ideal solution (representing the worst possible performance). Based on these distances, a relative closeness score is calculated for each alternative, indicating its proximity to the ideal solution.  Alternatives with higher closeness scores are deemed more desirable. \ref{appendix:cal_example} provides a detailed, step-by-step example demonstrating the TOPSIS calculation process for Case 3. The TOPSIS analysis yielded a clear ranking of excess heat utilization options for each case study, considering both stakeholder priorities (captured through AHP weights) and the technical and economic performance of each alternative.  

\subsubsection{Sensitivity Analysis}
Sensitivity analysis is a crucial step in evaluating the robustness of decision-making models, particularly in contexts characterized by uncertainty. In the domain of industrial excess heat recovery, where data can be uncertain and stakeholder priorities may vary, it is essential to assess the sensitivity of the recommended utilization options to potential changes in criteria weights and other key parameters. This section examines the sensitivity of the TOPSIS rankings generated by the framework to ensure the reliability of the decision recommendations.
To systematically investigate the potential impact of variations in criteria weights, a one-at-a-time (OAT) sensitivity analysis was conducted. For each criterion, the baseline AHP weight (see Table~\ref{table:AHP_weights}) was first reduced by 10\% and then by 20\%, with all other weights held constant. The TOPSIS analysis was then rerun with these adjusted weights to generate a new ranking under each variation. This process was repeated with 10\% and 20\% increases in the criterion weight, resulting in a total of five scenarios for each criterion in each case study.
Rank reversals, indicating changes in the preferred order of alternatives, served as the primary metric for assessing sensitivity. However, even in scenarios without rank reversals, changes in the relative closeness scores (reflecting the strength of preference for each alternative) were also analyzed. Table \ref{table:sensitivity_summary} provides a summary of the sensitivity analysis results across all six case studies.

\textbf{Case 1: Cement Production} & Internal Process Heat $\succ$ Alternative Fuel $\succ$ District & No & No & No & Closeness scores for ``District Heating" were most sensitive to changes in the weight for CO2 Reduction. \\
& Recovery & & & & \\ \hline
\textbf{Case 2: Metal Casting} & Electricity Gen. $\succ$ Heat-to-Fuel $\succ$ Process & Yes & No & Yes & Rank reversal between ``Electricity Generation" and ``Process Integration" occurred when NPV weight decreased or Payback Period weight increased. \\
& Integration & & & & \\ \hline
\textbf{Case 3: Industrial Park} & Inter-industry Exchange $\succ$ DH Int. $\succ$ Ind. & No & No & No & Closeness scores remained relatively stable across all weight variations. \\
& Solutions & & & & \\ \hline
\textbf{Case 4: District Heating} & DH Network Integration $\succ$ Process Steam & No & No & No & Ranking remained highly stable. Small changes in closeness scores were observed with variations in the Public Acceptance weight. \\
& Supply & & & & \\ \hline
\textbf{Case 5: Multi-Sectoral DH} & DH with Industrial Heat $\succ$ Ind. Industry & No & No & No & Ranking stable. Slight changes in closeness scores when varying the weight of ``Cost-Effectiveness".\\
& Solutions & & & & \\ \hline
\textbf{Case 6: Residential DH with P2P} & P2P with CHP Integration $\succ$ DH w/o CHP & No & No & No & Ranking robust. Minor changes in closeness scores observed for both options when varying the ``Consumer Benefits" weight. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
}
\end{table*}

Figure \ref{fig:sensitivity_case2} illustrates the impact of varying the weights for NPV and Payback Period on the ranking of utilization options for Case 2 (Metal Casting). The horizontal bars represent the TOPSIS scores for each option under different weight variation scenarios. The dashed vertical line marks the baseline scenario with the original AHP weights. As the NPV weight increases, signifying a stronger emphasis on long-term profitability, `Process Integration' surpasses `Electricity Generation' in preference due to its higher NPV. Conversely, when the Payback Period weight increases (implying a lower NPV weight), `Electricity Generation' regains its top ranking as short-term financial returns gain more importance. This sensitivity highlights the critical trade-off between NPV and Payback Period in this case study. Decision-makers should carefully consider their investment time horizons and financial priorities when selecting the optimal excess heat utilization strategy in such contexts.
\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.65\columnwidth]{images/sensitivity_example_case2.pdf} 
\caption{Sensitivity Analysis - Impact of Varying Weights for NPV and Payback Period (Case 2: Metal Casting)}
\label{fig:sensitivity_case2}
\end{figure}
This observation underscores the importance of careful consideration of economic factors in metal casting applications. If a company prioritizes short-term returns (emphasizing Payback Period), ``Process Integration" may emerge as the favored choice, but a focus on long-term value creation (higher NPV) would shift the preference to ``Electricity Generation".
In general, the sensitivity analysis suggests that the decision recommendations produced by the framework are robust for most case studies, even under plausible variations in criteria weights. However, as observed in Case 2, specific contexts might require more in-depth consideration of potentially sensitive criteria and their associated data. It is essential for decision-makers to be aware of such sensitivities and carefully scrutinize the underlying assumptions and data when applying this or any decision-making framework.
Further research can focus on expanding this analysis by incorporating variations in other key parameters, exploring additional sensitivity analysis techniques such as scenario analysis or Monte Carlo simulation, and analyzing the influence of combined weight variations to provide an even more comprehensive assessment of the framework's robustness and reliability.

\subsection{Illustrative TOPSIS Calculation Example (Case 3: Industrial Park)}
\label{appendix:cal_example}
This appendix provides a concise overview of the TOPSIS calculation process applied to Case 3 (Industrial Park) to rank excess heat utilization options.

\paragraph{Step 1: Normalized Performance Matrix}
The performance matrix is normalized by dividing each criterion value by the square root of the sum of the squares of the corresponding criterion values across all alternatives. The normalized performance matrix is presented in Table~\ref{table:TOPSIS_case3}.

\paragraph{Step 2: Weighted Normalized Matrix}
Each normalized performance value is then multiplied by its corresponding weight derived from the AHP process. The weights for Case 3 are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Economic Synergy Potential: 0.35
    \item Energy Efficiency Improvement: 0.25
    \item Reduction in External Energy Dependence: 0.20
    \item Ease of Implementation: 0.20
\end{itemize}

\noindent The resulting weighted normalized matrix is:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Weighted Normalized Matrix - Case 3 (Industrial Park)}
\label{table:weighted_normalized_matrix}
\begin{tabular}{|l|cccc|}
\hline
\textbf{Utilization Option} & \textbf{Economic} & \textbf{Energy} & \textbf{External} & \textbf{Ease of} \\
 & \textbf{Synergy} & \textbf{Efficiency} & \textbf{Energy} & \textbf{Implementation} \\
 & & \textbf{Improvement} & \textbf{Dependence} & \\ \hline
Inter-industry Heat Exchange & 0.315 & 0.1875 & 0.16 & 0.14 \\ \hline
Integration with DH Network & 0.21 & 0.2125 & 0.18 & 0.12 \\ \hline
Individual Solutions & 0.14 & 0.125 & 0.12 & 0.16 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Step 3: Ideal and Negative-Ideal Solutions}
The ideal solution represents the best values across all criteria, while the negative-ideal solution represents the worst values:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ideal Solution (A\textsuperscript{*}): [0.315, 0.2125, 0.18, 0.16]
    \item Negative-Ideal Solution (A\textsuperscript{-}): [0.14, 0.125, 0.12, 0.12]
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Step 4: Distance Calculations}
The Euclidean distance of each alternative from the ideal and negative-ideal solutions is calculated.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Distances from Ideal and Negative-Ideal Solutions - Case 3}
\label{table:distances_case3}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Utilization Option} & \textbf{S\textsuperscript{*}} (Distance to Ideal) & \textbf{S\textsuperscript{-}} (Distance to Negative-Ideal) \\ \hline
Inter-industry Heat Exchange & 0.084 & 0.192 \\ \hline
Integration with DH Network & 0.118 & 0.141 \\ \hline
Individual Solutions & 0.202 & 0.045 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Step 5: Relative Closeness Calculation}
The relative closeness $C_i$ of each option to the ideal solution is calculated as follows:
\[
C_i = \frac{S^-}{S^* + S^-}
\]

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Relative Closeness Scores and Ranking - Case 3}
\label{table:closeness_case3}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Utilization Option} & \textbf{C\textsubscript{i}} (Relative Closeness) & \textbf{Ranking} \\ \hline
Inter-industry Heat Exchange & 0.694 & 1 \\ \hline
Integration with DH Network & 0.544 & 2 \\ \hline
Individual Solutions & 0.182 & 3 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Step 6: Ranking}
Based on the relative closeness scores, Inter-industry Heat Exchange is ranked as the most favorable option for Case 3.
